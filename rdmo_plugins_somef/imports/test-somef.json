However, we want to provide a stable software for the community and therefore ask you to follow the following workflow.\n\nHere is a list of important resources for new contributors:\n\n- [Source Code](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo)\n- [Documentation](https://rdmo.readthedocs.io)\n- [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/issues)\n- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n\n## How to report a bug\n\nIf you found a bug or want a feature to be added, look at the existing [issues](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/issues) first. If you find a corresponding issue, please comment on it. If no issue matches, create one (select \"Bug report\").\n\nWhen filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:\n\n- Which operating system and Python version are you using?\n- Which version of this project are you using?\n- What did you do?\n- What did you expect to see?\n- What did you see instead?\n\nThe best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case, and/or steps to reproduce the issue.\n\n## How to request a feature\n\nIf you want a feature to be added, look at the existing [issues](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/issues) first. If you find a corresponding issue, please comment on it. If no issue matches, create one (select \"Feature request\").\n\nIf you decide to work on the issue yourself, please wait until you received some feedback from us. Maybe we are already working on it (and forgot to comment on the issue), or we have other plans for the affected code.\n\n## How to set up your development environment\n\nYou need [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads).\n\nInstall the package with development requirements:\n\n```console\n$ pip install -e \".[dev]\"\n$ pip show rdmo\nName: rdmo\nVersion: 2.0.0\n[...]\n```\n\nSee also: [Development docs](https://rdmo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/setup.html).\n\n## How to test the project\n\nRun the full test suite with pytest:\n\n```console\n$ pytest\n```\n\nSee also: [Testing docs](https://rdmo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/testing.html).\n\n## How to submit changes\n\nIt is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything. This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.\n\nPlease fork our repository and create a new branch named according to what you want to do (e.g. `fix_login_form` or `fancy_feature`).\n\nOpen a [pull request](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/pulls) to submit changes to this project. Afterwards, check if your branch is still up to date. If not perform a rebase. The project team will review your pull request.\n\nYour pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:\n\n- The pytest suite must pass without errors and warnings.\n- Include unit tests.\n- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.\n\nFeel free to submit early, though\u2014we can always iterate on this.\n\nTo run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:\n\n```console\n$ pre-commit install\n```\n\nTo run the linting and code formatting checks (e.g. ruff) on the entire code base, use the command:\n\n```console\n$ pre-commit run --all-files --color=always\n```\n\nThese checks will run as a CI job as well.\n\n## Code style\n\nPlease use the [coding standards from the Django project](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/) and try to follow our conventions as close as possible.\n\n---\n\n*This contributor guide is adapted from [cookiecutter-hypermodern-python 2022.6.3 (MIT License)](https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python/blob/2022.6.3/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_name%7D%7D/CONTRIBUTING.md).*\n"
